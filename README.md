# AlternativeFinnish
In an attempt to prove that Finnish is a random compilation of letters and occasional doubling of certain letters, I will try to randomly generate words and compare them to my Finnish database. But first I needed to do some statistics on the Finnish language regarding the occurence of characters in words. I was lucky to find a generous database of over 94000 words.
