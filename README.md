# AlternativeFinnish (WIP)
In an attempt to prove/disprove that Finnish is a random compilation of letters and occasional doubling of certain letters, I will try to randomly generate words and compare them to my Finnish database.

Weighted randomness is based on actual statistics derived from a real database.

But first I needed to do some statistics on the Finnish language regarding the occurence of characters in words. I was lucky to find a generous database of over 94000 words.

I edited the database to my needs (see previous versions of Finnish_wordlist_edited_v003.xlsx)

For my first analysis I only used Excel and simple commands (see Finnish_wordlist_edited_v003.xlsx)

My first statistical results using python script Finnish_Alternative_ver001_002_GitHub.py (see Finnish_Alphabet_FirstResults.xlsx)

More to follow...

Disclaimer: I don't speak or understand any Finnish (at least for now), this all started when I was driving with a colleague of mine through Switzerland and a Finnish song was playing on the radio. As I read the title I couldn't resist cracking a joke. What started as a bad joke became a challenge and a new project to practice my hobby in coding with python. If you're Finnish and/or human you shouldn't feel offended. When/If I finish my project it should be applicable to any language provided a similar database. And then we could mock Swedish and prove it is random too.
